## Overview
Price Aggregator is a microservice for aggregation, retrieval and caching of prices of financial
instruments.

The microservice is providing the following functionalities:
- an API Endpoint to request the aggregated instrument price at a specific time point
with hour accuracy.
  - The aggregated price will be served from the datastore if itâ€™s already available
  - If not available, the prices will be requested from the external sources,
  aggregated, then persisted and returned by the endpoint
  

- an API Endpoint that fetches the persisted instrument prices from the datastore
  during a user-specified time range

## Technologies and tools 
- ASP.NET Core 7.0
- Entity Framework Core 7.0 (with In-memory DB)
- XUnit, Fluent Assertions
- WireMock
- Circle CI

## Architecture
The solution is following the Clean Architecture principles and DDD.

## How to run the API
From an IDE (Rider or Visual Studio), run `PriceAggregator.API`.

The API provides Swagger UI which allows to interact with the API.

### Database configuration
The solution is configured to use an in-memory database. The solution can be run without needing 
to set up any additional infrastructure.

## Testing
CircleCI runs integration tests for the microservice whenever a commit is pushed to the 
main branch. 

These tests use a standalone WireMock stub server managed by docker-compose to mimic the behavior of external APIs.


*Due to time limitations, the project does not currently have unit tests. 
However, integrating SonarCloud would help generate code coverage reports for each Pull Request. This integration would prevent a PR from being merged if it fails to meet the required code coverage percentage.

### How to run the integration tests
From a terminal run:

```
docker-compose up
```
After the container is up and running, run the integration tests:
```
dotnet test PriceAggregator.IntegrationTests/PriceAggregator.IntegrationTests.csproj
```
